Things that need to be done, in no particular order:

- Code:
  * Patch HSQL to use column numbers instead of names for
    SQLTables and SQLColumns.
  * Handle exceptions in a driver-independent way
  * Support all SQL datatypes
    - DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP
  * Make row retrieval lazy in HSQL driver
  * Make Query.exprs type safe
  * switch ad-hoc assert to Control.Expcetion.assert
  * change insert to work like insertNew and remove insertNew 
    (is this a good idea?)
  * ppPrimExpr seems to print a newline character after every binary
    operator.
  * Result columns may contain NULL values even if the corresponding
    database column doesn't. Consider for example the somewhat
    contrived query: "SELECT NULL AS first_name FROM d3proj_users"
  * make {odbc,mysql,postgresql}Connect take a Database argument 
    instead of a HSQL argument. This would allow more general type
    signatures in user code. (Added by Bjorn)

- DbDirect 
  (* add optional command line argument for selecting which
  tables to generate code for)

- Installation
  * GHC package specification
  * Packages (separate binary packages for Hugs and GHC?))
    - Source tarball
    - Linux binary and source RPMs 
    - Windows installer (MSI?)

- Build system
  * Automatic configuration (autoconf or something)

- More database drivers
  * wxHaskell

- Documentation
  * Haddock comments on all exported functions, classes and types
  * Tutorial
  * Example programs

- Testing
  * Test on Windows, Solaris, Linux, Mac OS X
  * Test against different DB systems, at least MySQL, PostgreSQL,
    Oracle
  * Test under GHC and Hugs
  * Test all functions
  * Test all datatypes
  * Test NULL and NOT NULL fields

- Misc
  * Get an allocated name in the hierarchical library namespace 
    (Database.HaskellDB?)
