Things that need to be done, in no particular order:

- Code:
  * Patch HSQL to use column numbers instead of names for
    SQLTables and SQLColumns.
  * Handle exceptions in a driver-independent way
  * Support all SQL datatypes
    - DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP
  * Make row retrieval lazy in HSQL driver
  * Make Query.exprs type safe
  * switch ad-hoc assert to Control.Expcetion.assert
  * change insert to work like insertNew and remove insertNew 
    (is this a good idea?)
  * It seems like the optimization step propagates
    field values throughout the query instead of field names. 
    For example, this code:

     avgWorkChunks
	= do
	      reports <- table d3proj_time_reports
	      users <- table d3proj_users
	      restrict (reports!user .==. users!xid)
	      r <- project (first_name << users!first_name 
			    # last_name << users!last_name
		            # hours << avg reports hours)
	      order [asc r hours]
	      return r

    Generates this query:

    SELECT DISTINCT first_name2 as first_name,
                    last_name2 as last_name,
                    AVG(hours1) as hours
    FROM (SELECT DISTINCT id as id2,
                          first_name as first_name2,
                          last_name as last_name2
          FROM  d3proj_users as T1) as T1,
         (SELECT DISTINCT user as user1,
                          hours as hours1
          FROM  d3proj_time_reports as T1) as T2
    WHERE (user1 = id2)
    GROUP BY first_name2,
             last_name2
    ORDER BY AVG(hours1) ASC

    But the last line should be "ORDER BY hours ASC", since we do not
    want that recalculated, and at least MySQL does not support 
    aggregate functions in the "ORDER BY" clause. 
  * ppPrimExpr seems to print a newline character after every binary
    operator.
