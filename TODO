Things that need to be done, in no particular order:

- Code:
  * Support all SQL datatypes
  * make SQL generation tweakable by the DB driver, since different
    DBs have different SQL syntax, for example TOP / LIMIT.
    Added by Bjorn, suggested by Shae Erisson.
  * Figure out some intutive way of doing grouping.
  * Fix semantics of lazyQuery.
  (* strictness checking. In other words: optimize the code to sort out what
     types and expressions are evaluated strictly, and explicitly tell the
     compiler that they are strict)
  (* maybe make it work on multi-processor systems using Concurrent Haskell?)
  (* try to compile with nhc98. It would be nice to support all three 
     available Haskell compilers)
  (* Add features for adding and modifying tables /Added by Bjorn,
     suggested by Shae Erisson)
  (* use template haskell to compile queries to SQL at compile time 
     /Added by Bjorn, thanks to Anders Carlsson for inspiration )

- DbDirect 
  * Set sensible default values for all NOT NULL columns.
  (* add optional command line argument for selecting which
  tables to generate code for)

- Installation
  * Install targets should install DbDirect and the documentation.
  * Packages (separate binary packages for Hugs and GHC?))
    - Source tarball
    - Linux binary and source RPMs (debs, ebuild?)
    - Windows installer (MSI?)

- Build system 

- Database drivers

  * Add more drivers:
     - Oracle (http://cvs.sf.net/viewcvs.py/haskell-libs/libs/takusen/)

  * wxHaskell:
    - Figure out how to handle wrapping wxHaskell execute calls
      in transactions intelligently.
    - Make dbQuery lazy.
    - Make it work in Hugs.

  * SQLite:
    - Make SQLite report more useful types. Make HSQL parse the original
      create query from the meta-table?

- Documentation
  * Haddock comments on all exported functions, classes and types
  * Tutorial
  * Example programs

- Testing
  * Test on Windows, Solaris, Linux, Mac OS X
  * Test against different DB systems, at least MySQL, PostgreSQL,
    Oracle
  * Test under GHC and Hugs
  * Test all functions
  * Test all datatypes
  * Test NULL and NOT NULL fields

- Misc
  * Get an allocated name in the hierarchical library namespace 
    (Database.HaskellDB?)
