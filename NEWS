HaskellDB 0.7:

- Added functions for creating and dropping tables and databases.
  Too be improved in future releases.

  the limiting factor when doing database operations
- Transactions are now supported

- Better documentation
- Many, many bug fixes

HaskellDB 0.5, changes from Daan Leijen's HaskellDB:
- Support for both GHC and Hugs
- Redesigned type system to remove dependency on Typed Record Extensions
- Uses HSQL to access ODBC, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases
- Fixed various bugs
- Haddock documentation
- Uses standard library where possible
- Metadata functions have been added
- Dbdirect now uses metadata functions to generate database info
- Dbdirect produces files in a new format
- Proper build system (using autoconf/configure/GNU make)
- Uses new notation compared to Leijen's HaskellDB
- Two old HaskellDB functions have been changed. The old insert is now
  insertQuery. The old insertNew is now insert
