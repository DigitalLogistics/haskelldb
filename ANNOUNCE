We are pleased to announce the third alpha release of our "remake" of
HaskellDB, version 0.7. The main feature of this release is support
for wxHaskell. Read on below for more information about it.

HaskellDB is a Haskell library for expressing database queries and
operations in a type safe and declarative way. HaskellDB compiles a
relational algebra-like syntax into SQL, submits the operations to the
database for processing, and returns the results as ordinary Haskell
values.

The original version of HaskellDB was written by Daan Leijen and is
available at http://www.haskell.org/haskellDB/. The implementation is 
based on his paper which can be found at:  
http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/daan/download/papers/dsec.ps

New in HaskellDB 0.7:

- Added functions for creating and dropping tables and databases.
  Too be improved in future releases.
- Support for wxHaskell when using ghc.
- Overloaded (!) can be used for both (!) and (!.)
- Many, many bug fixes

About wxHaskell:
Works only with GHC. Does not work with MySQL as far as we know.
      
NOTE: Due to changes in DbDirect, any files generated using the old 
version of HaskellDB should be regenerated.

The developers can be reached at haskelldb-users@lists.sourceforge.net or
on #haskelldb at irc.freenode.net.
