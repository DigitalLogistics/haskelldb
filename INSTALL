Quick install:

./configure
make
make install


Install from CVS:

autoconf
./configure
make
make install


Requirements:

- GHC 6.2

- GNU Make 3.79.1

- Hugs November 2003 (if you want Hugs support)

- HSQL 1.2 or later (preferably later) (http://htoolkit.sourceforge.net/)

  It is preferrable to have HSQL installed
  in the GHC and Hugs library directories, but it is possible to build
  against HSQL in an arbitrary location. If HSQL is not installed
  in the normal library directories, add --with-hsql-dir=DIR when
  running /configure for HaskellDB. If you have a compiled but not 
  installed version of HSQL, DIR should be <wherever you put HSQL>/build.

  When building HSQL, remember to enable all drivers that you are
  going to use. Example of building and installing HSQL :

  $ ./configure --enable-odbc --enable-mysql --enable-postgres
  $ make
  $ make install

  * Extra requirements for Windows
  
    - Cygwin (found at www.cygwin.com)
      Except the default packages you will also need Make and GCC
  
    - Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) SDK (found at 
      www.msdn.com/download)
  

Database support:

- ODBC

  HaskellDB should work with all ODBC drivers, assuming that the database
  supports the queries generated by HaskellDB. This does for exaemple 
  currently not include the stable version of MySQL, see below.

- MySQL

  HaskellDB only works with MySQL version >= 4.1 since earlier
  versions don't support for nested subqueries.

  MySQL only supports transactions on transaction-safe table types,
  such as InnoDB and BDB. The default table type, MyISAM does not
  support transactions. See the MySQL manual for more information.

  MySQL 4.1 does not support intersect.

- PostgreSQL

  Should work.
