Quick compile:

autoconf    (only needed if compiling from CVS)
./configure
make

Requirements:

- GHC 6.2

- Hugs November 2003 (if you want Hugs support)

- The CVS version of HSQL (we have tested against the 2004-01-24
  version, which is the one checked out by the using the instructions
  below). The build system assumes that there is a sibling directory
  to the directory that this file is in named HSQL-cvs. That directory
  contains a copy of src/drivers/hsql/Makefile.HSQL named Makefile,
  the CVS version of HSQL in a directory named HSQL and a symlink to
  the HSQL directory named Database.

  This can be set up as follows (starting in the directory that this
  file is in.  
  > mkdir ../HSQL-cvs 
  > cp src/drivers/hsql/Makefile.HSQL ../HSQL-cvs/Makefile
  > make -C ../HSQL-cvs

  HSQL should be built with ODBC support. The instructions above will
  do that.

- To build and use HSQL with ODBC on Unix you need to have unixODBC
  installed.

- For unixODBC you need the client libraries for your database system
  and the ODBC libraries for that system.

- You will need a database system to connect to (though that might of
  course be on a different machine). 

Database software support:

- MySQL

  HaskellDB does not work with MySQL version < 4.1 because of the
  lack of support for nested subqueries. 

  * MyODBC:  
  tar -zxf MyODBC-3.51.06.tar.gz
  cd MyODBC-3.51.06
  ./configure --enable-shared --with-samples=no --with-debug=yes \
  --with-unixODBC=/usr
