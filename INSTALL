Quick install:

./configure
make
make install


Compile from CVS:

autoconf
./configure
make
make install


Requirements:

- GHC 6.2

- Hugs November 2003 (if you want Hugs support)

- The current CVS (2004-02-01) version of HSQL must be installed.
  When building HSQL, remember to enable all drivers that you are
  going to use. Example of building and installing HSQL :

  $ ./configure --enable-odbc --enable-mysql --enable-postgres
  $ make
  $ make install


Database support:

- MySQL

  HaskellDB only works with MySQL version >= 4.1 since earlier
  versions don't support for nested subqueries.
