Requirements:

- GHC 6.2

- The current CVS (2004-02-01) version of HSQL must be installed.
  When building HSQL, remember to enable all drivers that you are
  going to use. Example of building and installing HSQL :

  $ ./configure --enable-odbc --enable-mysql --enable-postgres
  $ make
  $ make install

  Extra requirements for Windows
  
  - Cygwin (found at www.cygwin.com)
    Except the default packages you will also need Make and GCC
  
  - Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) SDK (found at 
    www.msdn.com/download)

- MySQL

  HaskellDB only works with MySQL version >= 4.1 since earlier
  versions don't support for nested subqueries.
