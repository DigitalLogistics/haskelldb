Requirements:

- GHC 6.2

- Hugs November 2003 (if you want Hugs support)

- The CVS version of HSQL. The build system assumes that there is a
  sibling directory to the directory that this file is in named
  HSQL-cvs. That directory contains a copy of
  src/drivers/hsql/Makefile.HSQL named Makefile, the CVS version 
  of HSQL in a directory named HSQL and a symlink to the HSQL
  directory named Database.

  This can be set up as follows (starting in the directory that this
  file is in.  
  > mkdir ../HSQL-cvs 
  > cp src/drivers/hsql/Makefile.HSQL ../HSQL-cvs/Makefile
  > make -C ../HSQL-cvs
