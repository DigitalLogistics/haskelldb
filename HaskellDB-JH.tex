Scrap your SQL strings! The HaskellDB library provides a set of
combinators based on the ``relational algebra'' for expressing
queries, inserts, and updates. It lets you abstract over every part of
your query, from conditions, to tables, to the columns
returned. HaskellDB uses the HDBC family of database drivers to talk to a
wide variety of databases.
