This is where we keep track of reported and fixed bugs, mostly for 
bragging rights at the end of the project:

- Krasimir Angelov reported these two bugs 2004-02-04:

    * "The PrimQuery imports List module instead of
      Data.List which make HaskellDB dependent from
      Haskell98 package. In the haskelldb.pkg script the
      Haskell98 package is not added in the dependency list.
      The package works well with modified PrimQuery where
      the List is replaced with Data.List."

    * "In the makefile the ghc-pkg tool is called with
       -g option to autogenerate library for GHCi. The
       trouble here is that if there already exist HShdb.o
       object then the tool ignores the option. The work
       arround which I use in HSQL is to remove HShdb.o from
       the GHC directory before the install phase."

    Bjorn fixed these bugs on 2004-02-04.

- shapr reported a bug in Dbdirect 2004-02-07. For some reason DbDirect 
didn't generate Tables that had a Maybe type for String, it just made them 
String. Chucky fixed this on 2004-02-08

- shapr reported a bug in Dbdirect 2004-02-11, where a Table and a Field, 
  if they had the same name, would clash in the generated file. Chucky 
  fixed this on 2004-02-17

- viblo reported 2004-02-18 that top and topPercent produce invalid
  SQL. Bjorn fixed top and removed topPercent on 2004-02-22.

- viblo reported 2004-02-18 that union produces invalid SQL. Bjorn
  fixed this on 2004-02-22.

- Jeremy Shaw (stepcut), reported 2004-02-29 that dates were not
  formatted correctly, and were not quoted (e.g. 2004-February-27
  12:0:0). Bjorn had already fixed this problem 2004-02-26.
