This is where we keep track of reported and fixed bugs, mostly for 
bragging rights at the end of the project:

- shapr reported a bug in Dbdirect 2004-02-07. For some reason DbDirect 
didn't generate Tables that had a Maybe type for String, it just made them 
String. Chucky fixed this on 2004-02-08

- shapr reported a bug in Dbdirect 2004-02-11, where a Table and a Field, 
  if they had the same name, would clash in the generated file. NOT FIXED 
  YET.
