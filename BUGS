- There is currently no boolean type in HaskellDB. Some databases 
  implement this best using tinyint, some using boolean, and so on. The 
  "standard" portable way of doing this seems to be using tinyint, but 
  should this be something we decide? If we do, tinyint cannot be used for 
  anything else

- Inserting values into TIME columns in PostgreSQL does not work,
  since PostgreSQL doesn't like getting date and time as input to a 
  TIME column. We're working on a general solution to date handling issues.

- When using PostgreSQL with HSQL ODBC and wxHaskell, TIMESTAMP
  columns are treated as String fields. This seems to be a problem
  with the PostgreSQL ODBC driver.

- Since SQLite is untyped, all columns in SQLite databases are treated
  as having type String, even if some other type was used when the
  table was created.

- When compiling DbDirect-generated code for tables with many columns,
  GHC may need the -fcontext-stackXX flag, where XX needs to be at
  least around the number of columns in the largest table. Chucky tried
  to fix this by adding it as an OPTIONS pragma at the top of every
  generated file, but it turns out this is not currently supported by
  GHC. The code remains in case the GHC team starts to support it.

- When using lazyQuery with the MySQL driver and running a second
  query without retrieving all data from the first, you get the 
  error "Commands out of sync;  You can't run this command now".

- WXHaskell _REQUIRES_ that all changes that we want committed are wrapped 
  in transactions. We currently do not do this, it is up to the user.

- There is no way to do grouping explicitly, and tricking HaskellDB
  into doing the right thing is not always easy. Currently, if a
  project contains aggregate expressions, the results are grouped
  by all non-aggregate fields in the project.

- The wxHaskell backend doesn't work in Hugs.

- MySQL does case-insensitive comparison with LIKE, PostgreSQL does 
  case-sensititve. PostgreSQL uses ILIKE for case-insensitive
  matching. We need to make 'like' do the same for all backends.

- The following features are currently not supported:
  * stored procedures
  * natural joins (just use restrict)
  * db-specific types and functions
  * db-specific syntax (for example, only TOP is supported to limit
    the number of results)
  * db-specific quoting rules
  * db-specific restrictions on column and database names
  * db-specific table options (such as the table type in MySQL)
  * getting the value inserted into an auto_increment column.

- PostgreSQL does not accept inserting default values into non-null
  columns which do not have a set default value.

- Tables in unions may get the same table alias, which Not A Good
  Thing. This is a problem i Sql.ppSql.
