- Inserting values into TIME columns in PostgreSQL does not work,
  since PostgreSQL doesn't like getting date and time as input to a 
  TIME column. We're working on a general solution to date handling issues.

- When using PostgreSQL with ODBC, TIMESTAMP columns are treated
  as String fields. This seems to be a problem with the PostgreSQL
  ODBC driver.

- Since SQLite is untyped, all columns in SQLite datbases are treated
  as having type String, even if some other type was used when the
  table was created.

- When compiling DbDirect-generated code for tables with many columns,
  GHC may need the -fcontext-stackXX flag, where XX needs to be at
  least around the number of columns in the largest table.

- When using lazyQuery with the MySQL driver and running a second
  query without retrieving all data from the first, you get the 
  error "Commands out of sync;  You can't run this command now".

- Joins without a restrict generate SQL that uses non-existing 
  field names. Reported by Thomas Bevan 2004-03-16.
