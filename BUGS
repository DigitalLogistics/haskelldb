- Inserting values into TIME columns in PostgreSQL does not work,
  since PostgreSQL doesn't like getting date and time as input to a 
  TIME column. We're working on a general solution to date handling issues.

- When using PostgreSQL with HSQL ODBC and wxHaskell, TIMESTAMP
  columns are treated as String fields. This seems to be a problem
  with the PostgreSQL ODBC driver.

- Since SQLite is untyped, all columns in SQLite databases are treated
  as having type String, even if some other type was used when the
  table was created.

- When compiling DbDirect-generated code for tables with many columns,
  GHC may need the -fcontext-stackXX flag, where XX needs to be at
  least around the number of columns in the largest table.

- When using lazyQuery with the MySQL driver and running a second
  query without retrieving all data from the first, you get the 
  error "Commands out of sync;  You can't run this command now".

- Joins without a restrict generate SQL that uses non-existing 
  field names. Reported by Thomas Bevan 2004-03-16.

- WXHaskell _REQUIRES_ that all changes that we want committed are wrapped 
  in transactions. We currently do not do this, it is up to the user.

- Using aggregate functions outside of project (e.g. in restrict)
  generates invalid SQL. Reported by viblo.

- There is no way to do grouping explicitly, and tricking HaskellDB
  into doing the right thing is not always easy. Currently, if a
  project contains aggregate expressions, the results are grouped
  by all non-aggregate fields in the project.

- The wxHaskell backend doesn't work in Hugs.

- The following features are currently not supported:
  * default values
  * stored procedures
  * natural joins (just use restrict)
  * db-specific types and functions
  * db-specific syntax (for example, only TOP is supported to limit
    the number of results)
  * db-specific quoting rules
  * db-specific restrictions on column and database names
  * auto_increment columns
  * db-specific table options (such as the table type in MySQL)
